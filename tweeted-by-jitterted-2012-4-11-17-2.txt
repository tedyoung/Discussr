[190182309452972032] @jitterted (Wed Apr 11 13:59:30 PDT 2012): @agilecoach MapMyFitness uses Twitter OAuth and one of the permissions is "make changes to your profile".

--> Is in reply to: @pledgerwood, replying to status: 189450715306000388 - @jitterted @davidjbland But if the issue is that the PO thinks your complexity estimates are wrong, then that suggests different remedies.

[189449671016595456] @jitterted (Mon Apr 09 13:28:16 PDT 2012): @pledgerwood @davidjbland The PO can suggest changes to the story. Of course, so can anyone else on the team.
--> Is in reply to: @pledgerwood, replying to status: 189449084250243073 - @jitterted @davidjbland But there's nothing the PO can do to make a 13 be a 5.

[149273740952350720] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 15:43:27 PST 2011): @ourfounder @davidjbland It's because I can tell project mgmt if we can deliver feature X by the deadline, with sufficient advance notice.
--> Is in reply to: @ourfounder, replying to status: 149273272347918336 - @jitterted @davidjbland That's awesome. Do you think that's because of story points, or because your team has regular conversations?
[149273102117908480] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 15:40:55 PST 2011): @ourfounder @davidjbland My team benefits, because we get to continue developing software that's delivered on-time.
--> Is in reply to: @ourfounder, replying to status: 149272491595005952 - @davidjbland @jitterted I understand the theory behind them, but have never seen a team actually benefit from it.
[149272192985739264] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 15:37:18 PST 2011): @ourfounder I think there's a difference between story points being a proxy for time, and being able to use them for prediction.
--> Is in reply to: @ourfounder, replying to status: 149264999347535873 - I have never met a proponent of Story Points that hasn't ultimately described them as a proxy for time. #scrum #kanban #lean #agile
[149231609495830528] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:56:02 PST 2011): OK, that's enough political tweeting for today, have to watch my blood pressure. :-(
[149230868819492864] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:53:06 PST 2011): @marcjohnson That's the story of my last 3 months at work. sigh.
--> Is in reply to: @marcjohnson, replying to status: 149229941018472449 - If you don't know why and what, then why care about how?
[149230586064670720] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:51:58 PST 2011): @gdinwiddie Ah, that totally makes sense, then. It's only a tax increase if the wealthy or corporations are greatly affected. Silly me.
--> Is in reply to: @gdinwiddie, replying to status: 149229895610933248 - @jitterted No, of course not. It's only a tax increase if you let a capital gains tax cut expire.
[149229217178071040] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:46:32 PST 2011): So if the GOP lets the payroll tax cut expire, isn't that a TAX INCREASE?
[149228872112680960] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:45:10 PST 2011): @jfpoilpret Thanks, @justinsandercoe's site looks great! I need to step back to the basics for a bit.
--> Is in reply to: @jfpoilpret, replying to status: 149001356735299584 - @jitterted depending on your level, check out @justinsandercoe guitar learning site. Lots of good stuff there, including practice planning
[149224731365736448] @jitterted (Tue Dec 20 12:28:43 PST 2011): One lesson learned: browser-based metronomes don't keep time very well on my computer. Need an offline one with better visuals.

[148995398638379009] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 21:17:25 PST 2011): @dhemery I like it. Good way to break break out of a rut, too.
--> Is in reply to: @dhemery, replying to status: 148992766582599680 - @jitterted Those are examples of the "tie one habit (or technique) behind your back" strategy. I've used it with guitar and with writing.
[148995087853043712] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 21:16:11 PST 2011): @ckeithray It's kind of impressive, in a sick and twisted way.
--> Is in reply to: @ckeithray, replying to status: 148993929692463105 - @jitterted It's how congress maintains 90% incumbency with a 9% approval rating.
[148991822423793665] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 21:03:13 PST 2011): There's nothing like reading about writing to avoid actually, well, writing.
[148991627761958912] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 21:02:26 PST 2011): @dhemery Ah, ok, that's a good idea, I can do that. Thanks!
--> Is in reply to: @dhemery, replying to status: 148990915451682817 - @jitterted To make it interesting, play in one position over songs in different keys. Or on one string over songs of varying styles & tempos

[148988291373477888] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:49:11 PST 2011): @dhemery For 30 minutes? Dang, not sure I have the patience for that yet. Think I'll try the painfully slow 60bpm metronome exercise first.
--> Is in reply to: @dhemery, replying to status: 148986607851147264 - @jitterted Play for 30 min on one string. Or in one position. Or only hammerons, pull offs, and slides (no picking).
[148986380201107456] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:41:35 PST 2011): Whew! RT @industriallogic: FWIW, the "IL" in Kim Jong IL's name has nothing to do with Industrial Logic.  We are still alive and well.
[148985070865219584] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:36:23 PST 2011): A mechanical one would entail having to shop for one, which sure seems like procrastinating.
[148984929580101633] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:35:49 PST 2011): Now, the question is, do I use the metronome built into Amplitube, et al, or get a mechanical one?
[148984409159249920] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:33:45 PST 2011): @bitops lol. Hey, Curmudgeon.ly is available!

[148981443140399104] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:21:58 PST 2011): @bitops Are you saying Ted and Curmudgeon are equivalent? (Not disagreeing, just checking!)
--> Is in reply to: @bitops, replying to status: 148978664497885184 - @jitterted curmudgeon.ly? ;)
[148976652729323520] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 20:02:56 PST 2011): Aww drat, just realized Ted.ly redirects to bitly. Was thinking of buying it. :(

--> Is in reply to: @Bendre, replying to status: 148974110939156480 - @jitterted I go a little more deeper. Instead of reading just politics, I read some comments below these posts. No wonder my BP shoots up!
[148973953707282433] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 19:52:13 PST 2011): @bendre Regardless, we should totally have a jam session. I've got extra amps and guitars.
--> Is in reply to: @Bendre, replying to status: 148973580368093185 - @jitterted been recommending that! Even posted a agile n music suggestion on my blog :)..

[148972564654465024] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 19:46:41 PST 2011): @bendre Thanks. I think we need to add a "bring yer guitar" session to #SFAgile2012.
--> Is in reply to: @Bendre, replying to status: 148970942087970816 - @jitterted I like the techniques mentioned in @jamplay lessons. Start not-by-note note, on all frets across the neck in your muscle memory!
[148972322869612545] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 19:45:44 PST 2011): This is why I try to avoid reading about politics, it's just too aggravating.
[148972161858670592] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 19:45:05 PST 2011): The GOP is "structuring the votes in a manner that’s designed to give their members cover" over defeating the payroll tax holiday extension.
[148971436214718464] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 19:42:12 PST 2011): @rslawrence Good suggestion -- I think @bitops 's metronome idea with right-hand rhythm is now my plan.
--> Is in reply to: @rslawrence, replying to status: 148939200106987522 - @jitterted Most guitarists I work with have mostly paid attn to the left hand; I suggest including exercises for the right, too.
[148938199060844544] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 17:30:08 PST 2011): @bitops Ah yes, the metronome. Gawd I hated metronome work, but it's a good idea, thanks. :)
--> Is in reply to: @bitops, replying to status: 148937050823991296 - @jitterted and at least 5 minutes of practice with a metronome.
[148937994563354625] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 17:29:19 PST 2011): @rslawrence Yeah, I was thinking that -- hard to provide context in 140 chars. Looking for getting my fingers back in shape.
--> Is in reply to: @rslawrence, replying to status: 148936929910595585 - @jitterted Depends where you are now and what you want to improve. Replace "guitar" w/ "programming" & need for context is clear.
[148934991743680514] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 17:17:23 PST 2011): OK: You have 30 minutes a day to practice guitar. What are some good practice techniques?

[148883533388185600] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 13:52:55 PST 2011): @rslawrence But generally I like it when docs have diagrams: sequence, collaboration, etc.

[148883013919440896] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 13:50:51 PST 2011): @rslawrence I do have good examples, alas, they're internal confidential docs. Can't think of good publicly available ones right now.

--> Is in reply to: @jmeowmeow, replying to status: 148879260763963393 - @jitterted They're not paper docs you can sketch on as you go?
[148876490866556928] @jitterted (Mon Dec 19 13:24:56 PST 2011): It's tough being a visual learner and reading API docs that have no diagrams or pictures. :-(
